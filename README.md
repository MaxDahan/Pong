# Pong

To run Pong just download the jar and double click it. The ball increases in speed and bounces off the paddle at a sharper angle if the player's y movement is the same as the ball's y movement. The opposite is true. The ball will decrease in speed and bounce off the paddle at a wider angle if the player's y movement is the opposite as the ball's y movement. Pressing "ESCAPE" moves the user back a screen and pressing "C" just closes the game no-matter what screen the user is on.
